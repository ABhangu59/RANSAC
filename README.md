# RANSAC
Throughout Q1 and Q2 of 2023 -  I worked on developing a modified version of the RANSAC algorithm in Java, GoLang, Scheme and Prolog. 


If you're interested in running the files, you'll need test data. I've uploaded some test data that you can use to test the programs out, however to get the program started is a little
more than self explanatory.
